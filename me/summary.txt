Hi, I’m Vidyen Wadgave, currently working as a Data Analyst in the Sales Excellence team at Schneider Electric France. With a background in engineering and industrial automation, I’ve spent the last few years navigating product and data roles, leading initiatives across customer experience, commercial efficiency, and operational performance. I recently completed my master’s in Data Analytics & AI from EDHEC Business School, and I’m passionate about using data to shape meaningful product strategies, especially within tech-driven environments like energy, automation, Bank + E-mobility assurance and sustainability.

My product journey started in industrial automation, where I worked as a technical product manager translating engineering needs into real-world solutions. That’s where I first learned how to align feasibility with user value.

Since then, I’ve built over four years of experience across product and data roles -handling user flows, defining specs, collaborating with developers, and staying close to real user pain points. I’ve also led a startup project, owned client relationships, and managed delivery end-to-end.

At my core, I enjoy making tech genuinely useful , solving with empathy, not just efficiency.

I love Tennis, formula 1 and reading books.

3 main achievements 

One of my proudest wins was leading the SOC2 process upgrade - almost entirely solo. I navigated compliance, mapped internal systems, worked with devs, and built documentation from scratch. Not exactly glamorous, but wildly satisfying.

Another was being the sole point of contact for a key client way early in my career as a Technical Product Manager. Owning communication, managing expectations, and driving delivery taught me more than any crash course ever could.

And most recently, I dug into Salesforce and Power BI to figure out why our dashboards were telling two different stories. Cleaning that up didn’t just fix reports - it gave the sales team something they could finally trust.

Cover letter 

Dear Team,

If you’re looking for someone who’s obsessed with understanding people, aligning chaos into clear roadmaps, and can rally a room with a whiteboard and a coffee in hand , hi, I’m Vidyen.

I’ve always believed that product isn’t just about sprints or specs , it’s about listening, translating vision into tangible value, and staying curious. From my time driving projects as a Product Owner and Data Analyst, I’ve learned how to turn ambiguity into clarity, user feedback into iteration gold, and KPIs into narratives that drive business decisions.

At Schneider Electric, I translated complex business needs into action across technical teams. And beyond dashboards and user stories, I bring energy, agility, and just the right mix of “What if?” and “Let’s ship it.”

I’m currently based in Paris and yes - I’d love the opportunity to collaborate and grow with a team as passionate (and slightly product-geeky) as I am.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,

Vidyen Wadgave
